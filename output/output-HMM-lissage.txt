oxy - fuel combustion be the process of burn a fuel use pure oxygen instead of air as the primary oxidant .
since the nitrogen component of air be not heat , fuel consumption be reduce , and higher flame temperature be possible .
historically , the primary use of oxy - fuel combustion have be in welding and cutting of metal , especially steel , since oxy - fuel allow for higher flame temperature than can be achieve with a air - fuel flame .
there be currently research be do in firing fossil - fueled power plant with a oxygen - enriched gas mix instead of air .
almost all of the nitrogen be remove from input air , yield a stream that be approximately 95 % oxygen .
fire with pure oxygen would result in too high a flame temperature , so the mixture be dilute by mix with recycled flue gas , or stage combustion .
the recycled flue gas can also be use to carry fuel into the boiler and ensure adequate convective heat transfer to all boiler area .
oxy - fuel combustion produce approximately 75 % less flue gas than air fuel combustion and produce exhaust consist primarily of co 2 and h 2 o ( see figure ) .
the justification for use oxy - fuel be to produce a co 2 rich flue gas ready for sequestration .
economically speak this method cost more than a traditional air - fired plant .
the main problem have be separate oxygen from the air .
